# US-003: Unified Reminder Management System

## Requirements
- Centralized management of all reminder types: Medication, Missed Dose, Stock, Follow-up, Todos.
- Unified display in "Reminders" page.
- Sorted by time.
- Ability to mark reminders as done.
- **Constraint**: Do NOT modify data logic for "Today's Medication Plan" or "My Medications".

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: The API endpoint `GET /reminders` returns a unified list containing:
    - [ ] Upcoming medication reminders (derived from Plans)
    - [ ] Missed medication reminders (derived from Plans + Records)
    - [ ] Stock low reminders (derived from Medications)
    - [ ] Follow-up reminders (from FollowUps table)
    - [ ] Todos (from Todos table)
- [ ] **AC2**: The frontend "Reminders" page displays all these types.
- [ ] **AC3**: Medication reminders (upcoming/missed) are correctly calculated *without* modifying the underlying Plan/Record structure for the "Today" view.
- [ ] **AC4**: Users can mark a medication reminder as "taken" from the Reminders page, which creates a Record entry (logic check).
- [ ] **AC5**: Users can mark a Todo or Follow-up as done.
- [ ] **AC6**: The list is sorted by `due_time`.

**Output when complete:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`
